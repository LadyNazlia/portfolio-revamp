											<h2>How Important is Your GitHub?</h2>
											<h3>By Amanda Cutter - February 13, 2023</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											I want to preface this with, "I'm not a professional in the matter, 
											and this is purely based on my experiences in my developer journey thus far. 
											Also, I will be the first to admit that my GitHub is a mess, 
											but I'm working on it a bit more every day. 
											And I'm not calling you out any more than I am calling myself out."
										</p>
										<h4>The Little Green Squares</h4>
										<p>
											Now that that is out of the way, who really cares if you have dark green or light green squares 
											all the way across your GitHub profile for as long as you have been a developer? 
											To put it frankly, in my experience, you're probably actually the only person on the planet who cares.
										</p>
										<p>
											The green squares are cool, and if you are a visual goal-driven person, 
											then by all means, use those squares to drive you to code as much as you can
											so that you can continue to learn and become a better developer.
										</p>
										<p>
											If, however, you find yourself opening a project you were working on, 
											adding a comment that you will later delete, or changing the color of 
											something to "test" how it looks, then you quickly make a commit to get
											that little green square (Yes, I will be the first to admit that I have done this.), 
											then you may want to reconsider the green squares.
										</p>
										<p>
											Instead of pushing yourself to have 365 green squares every year 
											to "prove that you can code" or "show how dedicated you are," 
											you may want to utilize other features of GitHub instead.
										</p>
										<h4>What Else Is There?</h4>
										<p>
											Honestly, I'm still discovering new things on GitHub on a regular basis, 
											but I can say without a doubt that the green squares are not the coolest, 
											best, or most likely to help you get a job features available. 
											If you're looking for something to use, you can check out the free apps in Marketplace. 
											If you're bored, you can check out random things under the explore tab, 
											and you can play around with codespaces which allow you to code in the browser. 
											No download is needed.
										</p>
										<p>
											While all of these things sound like fun to explore and play around with, 
											I tend to be more of the person who asks not what I can get but what I
											can give to make the community better. There are three features of GitHub 
											that I feel can be utilized to contribute to the community. The first of which is…
										</p>
										<h5>1. Open Source Contributions</h5>
										<p>
											There are so many open-source repos out there, and many of them are in 
											desperate need of contribution. Not only can you brag on your resume 
											that you are an open source contributor, but you also gain experience 
											in coding with others (which benefits them too), working on larger projects 
											(which looks good on a resume but also helps the team succeed), and it's 
											just a lot of fun (and you can meet some pretty cool people too). I highly
											recommend open-source contributing. It can be intimidating, and it can be a 
											lot of work getting in there and getting started, but it is totally worth the 
											effort, and when that first pull request is accepted, and your changes are added 
											to the project, you get this overwhelming sense of pride that words really cannot explain. 
											If you ever doubt that you're a software engineer, find an open-source README that 
											needs some TLC, make a few changes and a pull request, and you will change your mind.
										</p>
										<h5>2. Pages</h5>
										<p>
											Page is a super cool feature of GitHub that my knowledge is limited on, and thus far, 
											I have only used it once. Essentially, it allows you to host static web content for free. 
											I think this is super cool because not only do you have code in your repo that people can study, 
											learn from, and use, but they can also see what the code produces by viewing the pages. 
											This allows for visualization and interaction that you don't get just by looking at the code in the repo.
										</p>
										<h5>3. Following</h5>
										<p>
											While following doesn't necessarily sound like something you would do to contribute, in my experience, 
											if you follow someone, they are likely to follow you. In this sense, you can learn from each other by
											keeping up with what the other is doing. It is more like an even trade, I help you, and you help me, 
											but a contribution to make the community stronger nonetheless. Plus, you may follow someone who ends 
											up being your colleague one day. You never know!
										</p>
										<p>
											Now, back to my original question…
										</p>
										<h4>Who Actually Cares?</h4>
										<p>
											Truth be told, it is likely no one actually cares about what is included in your individual GitHub. 
											According to a Tech Crunch article, as of January 2023, GitHub has officially hit 100 million active users. 
											That's kind of an intimidating number. Imagine if your green squares were the only thing that got 
											the attention of recruiters and hiring managers.
										</p>
										<p>
											Personally, I'd never get a job as a developer if that were the case.
											Mostly just because as much as I love coding, 
											I know that there are days when for my mental health and for my family,
											I have to step away from the code and do something else.
										</p>
										<p>
											I've been told by some people, "Those green squares show your dedication to learning, especially as a transitioning teacher." 
											I've been told by others, "I've been in the business for over ten years, and my GitHub is and has always been a mess."
											For recruiters, even those with a technical background, the code itself probably doesn't mean much (in my opinion, at least). So, who cares?
										</p>
										<p>
											I personally think there are three groups/people who may care about how your individual GitHub looks.
										</p>
										<h5>1. New Software Engineers</h5>
										<p>
											Think back to when you first started learning to code. Before ChatGPT existed, 
											when Stackoverflow was daunting and quite honestly terrifying, or maybe when you 
											started looking into open source for the first time. Stumbling across a really well-organized 
											and put-together GitHub profile was like finding gold, at least for me. Things like Developer 
											Roadmap and Free Programming Books were a gift. When I could read a programming book for free 
											or jump in there and grab someone's open-source code and play around with it to figure out how
											it worked, I was in newbie heaven.
										</p>
										<h5>2. Other Software Engineers</h5>
										<p>
											How many times have you gone to GitHub to try to find a solution or a code snippet to help make your life a bit easier? 
											I, for one, even after almost two years of learning to code, am still intimidated by Stackoverflow. 
											I still use it almost every day, but sometimes it is easier just to look at a repo on GitHub, especially a repo that has pages
											set up so I can see what the code produces. At the very least, looking at repos like Build Your Own X and Public APIs 
											give you resources and ideas for projects you can work on to improve your own coding skills.
										</p>
										<h5>3. You</h5>
										<p>
											In the end, if no one else on the planet cares about your GitHub profile or the content in your repos, there is always you. 
											Even if you are one of those developers who do it only for the money, you should at least take some pride in what you are doing. 
											I grew up in a house where I was always told, "If you're going to do something, do it right, or you're just wasting time." 
											And that is especially true if someone has to come behind you and clean up the mess you made.
										</p>
										<p>
											Take a little pride in your GitHub, even if you use a Readme Template for your projects or modify someone's
											Awesome GitHub Profile Readme. You don't have to dedicate weeks of your time to make your GitHub look amazing, 
											but sometimes the most basic effort put into something can create something amazing.
										</p>
										<h4>Conclusion</h4>
										<p>
											While green squares probably only matter to you, your GitHub profile could and probably should be 
											something you invest a bit of your time. You might not be publishing a curriculum like Web Development 
											For Beginners or interview prep like Coding Interview University, but you never know who might stumble 
											across one of your repos.
										</p>
										<p>
											At the very least, if you are in an interview and someone mentions your GitHub profile or a specific repo, 
											or asks you to show them what you've been working on recently, wouldn't 
											you feel a lot better knowing that it is something you put time and effort into, 
											and it is something you are proud to share or talk about if the opportunity presents itself.
										</p>
										<p>
											I challenge you, just as I have challenged myself, to step up and put more effort into making your GitHub something worth looking at. 
											(If you're already killing it at GitHub, share your knowledge, so the rest of us can too!)
