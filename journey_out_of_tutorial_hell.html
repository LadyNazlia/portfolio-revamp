											<h2>My Journey Out of TUtorial Hell</h2>
											<h3>By Amanda Cutter - March 2023</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											If you’ve been hanging around the tech world for the last year or two, you have probably 
											seen #100devs at some point. There are more than 46k people in the #100devs discord community 
											at the time of writing this. We are on Discord and Linked In. The #100devs can be seen all over 
											Twitter, and classes can be found on Twitch and YouTube. We are probably secretly trying to take 
											over the world, but that’s just hearsay.
										</p>
										<p>
											I’m not writing this to brag about or even really talk about #100devs specifically. I want to talk 
											about how I got out of tutorial hell. If you want to know more about why I was stuck in tutorial 
											hell for nearly 15 years, check out my last blog post.
										</p>
										<p>
											Several things led me to getting out of tutorial hell. While #100devs was a part of it, my first 
											step out of tutorial hell started about six months before I joined #100devs. All in all, four 
											significant things helped rescue me from the grips of tutorial hell to get me to where I am: an 
											opportunity to teach, #100devs, FreeCodeCamp, and moving back to America.
										</p>
										<p>
											Let me try to explain these without going into too many details. (If you’ve read a few of my 
											other blogs, you know that I can ramble and quickly fill a page or three.)
										</p>
										<h4>
											The Beginning of the End
										</h4>
										<p>
											The beginning of the end of my imprisonment in tutorial hell actually started with a conversation 
											with the principal at the school where I was working. I was complaining about the fact that the 
											school didn’t offer enough computer classes. At the very least, I felt we needed a keyboarding 
											class to teach those kids how to stop pecking at the keyboard whenever they had to type something. 
											It was truly painful to watch.
										</p>
										<p>
											Eventually, it became one of those “Well, why don’t you do something about it?” situations, and 
											over the next few months, it was decided that I would teach the AP Computer Science A class during 
											the following school year. I am not even going to lie, I was terrified, but the excitement of being 
											able to teach a programming class got me so excited.
										</p>
										<p>
											I quickly realized that I had a lot to learn because the class was based on Java, and it took a lot 
											of work to learn. Though I had done a C++ programming class five or six years before, I needed to 
											prepare for everything, and I had six months to teach myself before I started teaching some of the 
											most intelligent kids at the school.
										</p>
										<h4>
											Before One Can Teach
										</h4>
										<p>
											Before one can teach, one must learn. I started learning the curriculum that I would be teaching as 
											if I were a student. I really enjoyed it. It was challenging, but that was part of what I loved. 
											However, hints of tutorial hell kept sneaking back into my life, and I found myself shying away from 
											Java and running back to my comfortable HTML and CSS of FreeCodeCamp’s Responsive Web Design course.
										</p>
										<p>
											But something was different this time. Learning Java and realizing that HTML and CSS aren’t programming 
											languages awoke something inside of me that made me want to know what came next after HTML and CSS for 
											web development. That desire to learn what came next pushed me hard to finish the 300-hour course, and 
											about halfway through my first semester of teaching Java, I successfully completed the Responsive Web 
											Design course that I had actually started for the first time in college.
										</p>
										<p>
											I wasn’t done, though. Talking to my students about coding, debugging, how coding can help them in 
											college and their future careers, and just seeing their excitement motivated me to keep going. Even 
											though I was still learning Java so that I could teach the students, I wanted to know more about web
											development, and there was one primary reason why.
										</p>
										<h4>
											Going Back to America
										</h4>
										<p>
											At that point, I was about seven months away from going back to America and living there full-time. I 
											knew that I didn’t want to teach in America, and I was prepared to get a job at Walmart or something 
											to pay the bills until I figured out what I wanted to do next. (Thankfully, better things happened.)
										</p>
										<p>
											It only took me 15 years from my first programming class to the point of finally realizing that I wanted 
											to be a software engineer. Going back to America, not wanting to teach there, and having the opportunity 
											to teach programming in China all led me to start looking into ways to move further beyond tutorial hell 
											so that I could find a job as a software engineer.
										</p>
										<p>
											I had a lot of factors working against me. I had two degrees, both in the arts. Nothing to prove that I 
											could be a software engineer except the fact that I was a computer science teacher, but that was only 
											one of the eight years I was teaching. And the only “languages” I really knew and felt somewhat 
											comfortable with were HTML and CSS (markup languages). At that point, I didn’t realize how limited I 
											was, but I knew that getting a job as a software engineer in seven months while still working a 
											full-time job as a teacher of all things was going to be a huge undertaking. (Update: 14 months later, 
											and I’m still not working full-time as a software engineer, but I am getting one step closer every day!)
										</p>
										<h4>
											Final Step to Leaving Tutorial Hell Behind
										</h4>
										<p>
											After looking around at options, wanting to try my best not to get trapped in tutorial hell again, and 
											not having the money to go back to college or pay for an expensive boot camp, I stumbled across #100devs. 
											The creator of it called it an “Agency” that offered training to people who were impacted by the pandemic. 
											You weren’t paid, but you also didn’t have to pay anything.
										</p>
										<p>
											In other words, I qualified. So, I signed up.
										</p>
										<h4>
											Committed
										</h4>
										<p>
											I don’t know what it was, but there was just something about Leon and #100devs that caused me to be 
											committed to pushing through, to “carry the boats and logs,” as he would say, and to see it through 
											to the end. While I was still in China, that meant waking up on Monday mornings for office hours from 
											1-3 am every week for the last six months I was in China. It meant waking up and being ready to attend 
											class from 6-9 am on Wednesdays and Fridays, which also meant being fully prepared for my classes 
											because that was my normal planning time.
										</p>
										<p>
											I, to this day, do not know why I was so driven to do everything that I did as part of #100devs, 
											but I thank God that something pushed me and kept me going even when I was exhausted, stressed, 
											and burnt out.
										</p>
										<h4>
											Present Day
										</h4>
										<p>
											While I still struggle a bit with taking on too many things and running the risk of falling 
											back into tutorial hell, I am at a point now where I know what I want to do. I want to be 
											a web developer. I enjoy full-stack, but I want to focus on front-end development, and I want to 
											make sure that I am marketable.
										</p>
										<p>
											I still struggle to find balance, but instead of mindlessly following tutorials and doing nothing 
											beyond them, I read the documentation and try to apply things on my own. At the time of writing this, 
											I’m building a new portfolio, working on a project with a friend using Typescript and MUI (two things 
											I’ve never used before), and I’m trying to finish CS50.
										</p>
										<p>
											Am I still doing too much? Yes, probably. But the difference is that I am learning while doing this. 
											I’m discovering how to do things on my own as a programmer would do on the job. And I’m building and 
											working on projects by myself and with others that I want to do, not because a tutorial said, “Learn 
											React is one hour and build ten React Applications!” or something super unrealistic like that.
										</p>
										<p>
											So, while I probably rambled a bit more than I had planned to if you made it this far and you have 
											found yourself trapped in tutorial hell, there are ways to get out. Keep fighting. Find people to 
											support you. Fix your focus on one thing, and you will get out one day.
										</p>
										<p>
											If you are lucky enough not to be drowning in the never-ending tutorials of the web, remember what 
											Leon always says, “Go deep. Not wide.” In other words, find an area of focus and learn as much as you 
											can. Don’t jump from language to language because a Jack or Jill of all trades is a master of nothing 
											useful, left with very little to offer a company when looking for a job.
