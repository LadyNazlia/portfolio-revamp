# portfolio-revamp

After over a year of coding and nearly that long since I made my first portfolio, it is time to revamp it. This is where the revamping begins! While I am starting with a template (creds below) for ease of starting and the fact that I'm juggling a full time job, life, and other projects with this one, I am customizing it as much as I can with the time that I have. 

The goal of this project is not only to improve upon my original portfolio (linked below), but also to rebrand myself after getting married. With the reciting of out vows and signing of the papers, I will also be rebranding myself from Amanda Faulkenber A.K.A LadyNazlia to Amanda Cutter A.K.A LadyNazlia!

While my goal is to never stop learning, it doesn't hurt to take time and show off what you already know every once in a while.

<!-- A somewhat unusual but interesting responsive site template. I did this one to test out a
new pattern set I put together and I think it really came together well. As for use cases
it's kind of unspecific so hey, use it for whatever.

Feedback, bug reports, and comments are not only welcome, but strongly encouraged :)

This portfoliois build on a template that uses:
	- HTML
	- CSS
	- SASS
	- JavaScript

All of which I have mildly tweaked to make it my own, while still keeping the template creators original design in mind.
