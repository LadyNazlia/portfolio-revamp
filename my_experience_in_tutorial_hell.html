											<h2>My Experience in Tutorial Hell</h2>
											<h3>By Amanda Cutter - March 2023</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											My understanding of tutorial hell is when you start working on coding tutorials and never move beyond 
											them. Truthfully, I spent 15 years of my life jumping in and out of tutorial hell, thinking I was a 
											programmer every time I learned to style something in HTML with CSS. I really thought I was hot stuff 
											until, one day; I realized HTML and CSS are just markup languages. I wasn't even a programmer. How 
											embarrassing!
										</p>
										<p>
											Even after learning C++ for a semester after college, I still found myself going back to those HTML 
											and CSS tutorials. And I do not hate tutorials. I absolutely love all of the awesome content you can 
											glean from FreeCodeCamp, and Traversy Media has some phenomenal videos if you are more of a visual/auditory 
											learner.
										</p>
										<p>
											But are you really a programmer if all you do is follow tutorials? Are you really learning anything if you 
											can't or won't branch out beyond the step-by-step guides?
										</p>
										<p>
											Don't worry. I'm not calling you out. We have all been there. Tutorial hell is such an easy place to fall 
											into, and for me, there were a few reasons why I spent so many years jumping in and out of it. Now, I am 
											about to get real honest with you and with myself at the same time.
										</p>
										<h4>
											Fear
										</h4>
										<p>
											The biggest reason I kept jumping from one tutorial to the next, usually not even finishing one before 
											starting another, was that I was afraid. I was afraid to try to do anything on my own. I was worried 
											that I would fail if I moved on to more complex things. It got so bad that I restarted FreeCodeCamp's 
											Responsive Web Design Course at least five times over 3 or 4 years.
										</p>
										<h4>
											Commitment Issues
										</h4>
										<p>
											The second biggest reason was that I had commitment issues. I would start a tutorial, get frustrated, 
											or it would get hard, or I would get bored, and I would just quit before I ever really learned anything 
											new. I was afraid to commit. I tried everything from quick single-lesson tutorials to 300-hour tutorials 
											that were supposed to take months to complete. In the end, I always gave up, and if there was an off chance 
											that I did actually complete a full tutorial in something, I wasn't committed enough to grasp what I 
											learned to try to build something with it outside of the tutorial.
										</p>
										<h4>
											Laziness
										</h4>
										<p>
											The final biggest reason that I stayed in tutorial hell was simply laziness. I didn't want to do anything 
											that was "too hard," that took "too much time," or required "too much effort" because I was just being lazy. 
											Simply put. Laziness prevented me from moving out of tutorial hell and reaching my full potential.
										</p>
										<h4>
											Conclusion
										</h4>
										<p>
											The hard truth I still face today is that while I am not really stuck in tutorial hell regularly, and I 
											have learned so much stuff in the last year, I still struggle with fear, commitment issues, and laziness in my 
											journey to becoming a better software engineer. But unlike before, I don't let these things stop me. There 
											are days I don't want to do coding, so I don't.
										</p>
										<p>
											There are still numerous tutorials I have started and have yet to finish, but I haven't stopped learning 
											because I didn't finish them.
										</p>
										<p>
											And yes, 1000% there are things that I regularly face in learning to be a better software engineer that 
											scares the crap out of me, but I keep pushing forward.
										</p>
										<p>
											In the end, if I can lie down at night and say that I am in a better place than I was a year ago, I am 
											progressing, and that is precisely what it means to move beyond tutorial hell. If you want to know more 
											about what pulled me out of tutorial hell and jump-started my journey to becoming a software engineer, 
											check out my next blog post.
