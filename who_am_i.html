											<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
											<h3>By Amanda Cutter - February 18, 2023</h3>
										</header>
										<span>I am many things.</span>
										<span>I am a woman of faith.</span>
										<span>I am a daughter.</span>
										<span>I am a sister.</span>
										<span>I am the love of someone's life.</span>
										<span>I am a friend.</span>
										<span>I am a martial artist.</span>
										<span>I am a writer.</span>
										<span>I am a cat mom and an animal lover.</span>
										<span>I am a teacher.</span>
										<span>I am a hard worker.</span>
										<span>I am a servant at heart, always willing to help.</span>
										<span>I am a person to vent to and a shoulder to cry on.</span>
										<h4>Simple Questions have Simple Answers</h4>
										<p>
											However, the question that I really want to address is: 
											Who am I in my career? The answer to that is still: 
											I am many things. I am a teacher. I am a software engineer. 
											I am a writer.
										</p>
										<p>
											The real question then becomes: Why does it matter that I 
											am not “just” a software engineer, or “just” a teacher, or “just” a writer?
										</p>
										<p>
											The answer to the question is kind of clique, but three is better than one.
											Simply put, the combination of skills that I gained and 
											used daily as a teacher and a writer work in tandem with my skills 
											as a software engineer to make me a better software engineer.
										</p>
										<p>
											So, a recruiter can look at my resume and say, “I see you don’t have any corporate experience.” 
											or “You really don’t meet the basic qualifications for this job.” They are missing a lot of amazing 
											qualities that someone “with corporate experience” or someone who “meets the basic qualifications” 
											may not have because they don’t have MY experiences.
										</p>
										<h4>Let’s Break It Down</h4>
										<p>
											I could easily just write a list of skills that make me a good software engineer because I am a teacher and a writer, 
											but I want to explain further how what I did at one job applies to the other. 
											So, I want to zero in on the top three skills that I bring to the table as a software engineer, teacher, and writer.
										</p>
										<h5>1. Written Communication</h5>
										<p>
											I have a master’s degree in professional writing from Liberty University, and I taught English writing classes 
											for several years throughout my eight years of teaching in China. While I have the verbal communications skills to match, 
											my written communication skills bring something to the table that a degree in computer science doesn’t offer.
										</p>
										<p>
											There is a joke that “The product is only as good as the documentation.” while I believe you can still have a good product, 
											even if the documentation sucks, having well-documented projects in plain English 
											that is easy for the average reader and developer to understand really is going the 
											extra mile to ensure the quality of a product.
										</p>
										<p>
											As an English teacher in China, I worked with a majority of students who did not speak English as their first language. 
											While I believe there is always room for improvement, I also believe that I have come very close to mastering the skill 
											of explaining something in the simplest terms possible without making someone feel dumb. 
											This comes in handy when communicating with clients, colleagues, and everyone else you encounter when doing a job.
										</p>
										<p>
											Good communication, written and verbal, are key to resolving conflict, solving problems, having healthy work 
											relationships with the people around you, and meeting your full potential as an employee of any company.
										</p>
										<h5>2. Creative</h5>
										<p>
											I am a strong believer in meeting deadlines, but everyone who has ever taught knows that there are times when 
											last-minute planning requires a bit of creativity to make things happen. I can tell some crazy stories 
											of last-minute lesson plans because of schedule changes and other uncontrollable events when I had to let 
											my creativity shine.
										</p>
										<p>
											As a writer and a novelist, creativity is kind of a primary job requirement, or you produce pretty boring books. 
											As someone who has published three books, I pride myself on being both a creative and a logical thinker. 
											I believe my sci-fi novel, Immortality: The Beginning of the End is a pretty good example of that. Sci-fi is a 
											great example of where logic and creativity come together to make something amazing.
										</p>
										<p>
											You may still be asking what creativity has to do with being a software engineer. I think the answer is simple. 
											Sometimes tough problems require a bit of creativity to find a solution. While many people consider computer 
											science to be a science (it is kind of in the name), I believe it, especially programming, requires creativity. 
											Creating projects, finding out-of-the-box and sometimes not logical solutions to problems, and adding creative 
											twists to things can make a good app a great one.
										</p>
										<h5>3. Adaptability/Flexibility</h5>
										<p>
											I tend to combine these as I believe they are basically synonyms. They mean the same thing. As a teacher, changes 
											in schedules, unexpected events, and even student engagement can require quick adaptations to lesson plans with no notice.
										</p>
										<p>
											When recruiters tell me that I don’t have corporate experience, I have to laugh a bit because, for someone with 
											classroom experience, I don’t think people without classroom experience realize how similar a high-stress, fast-paced, 
											competitive corporate job can compare to being in a classroom.
										<p>
											When clients change their minds, deadlines approach quickly, but the product isn’t finished yet, and things have to 
											happen fast; Adaptability and flexibility are a must. As a teacher, it was not uncommon for a student to come into the 
											classroom with a bad attitude that affected the whole class of students. That required quick thinking, a willingness 
											to make changes, and action. All of these things are useful as a software engineer, or any career for that matter. So...
										</p>
										<h4>That’s It?</h4>
										<span>Not even close/</span>
										<p>
											I haven’t even touched base on my technical skills. While I don’t claim to be a Java expert, 
											I taught myself Java for the sole purpose of being able to teach AP Computer Science A, 
											a college-level introduction to computer programming. That makes me studious, driven, and a willing student.	
										</p>
										<p>
											While teaching myself Java, because I realized what I really wanted to do was web development, I started learning HTML, CSS, 
											and JavaScript (which has nothing to do with Java). Eventually, I picked up MongoDB and Node.js. I’ve built my own REST API 
											with Express and learned a bit of React. This makes me a Full-Stack MERN Developer.
										</p>
										<p>
											On top of the basics, I have had some exposure to SASS. I’ve used Passport.js for user authentication, Cloudinary for storing 
											images from user input, and EJS for creating reusable bits of code to make coding a multiple-page website simpler.
										</p>
										<h4>Conclusion</h4>
										<p>
											I am all of these things and many more. I could write a whole book about the experiences, skills, and traits that I have 
											that I can offer to a company, a friend, a colleague, and even a stranger, but then where is the fun in that?
										</p>
										<p>
											Taking a chance on a person, giving them an opportunity to show their true colors, and setting them up for success 
											is all part of the process of hiring new employees. While it is a risky game to take a chance on someone, often 
											times what you see on paper is only the surface. After all, this blog post is over 1200 words, and it fills two and 
											a half pages. Most people looking at resumes only read a quarter of the first page. 
											How could anyone possibly decide if someone is fit for a job with that little knowledge of them?
