											<h2>How Important is Your GitHub?</h2>
											<h3>By Amanda Cutter - February 13, 2023</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											I want to preface this with, "I'm not a professional in the matter, 
											and this is purely based on my experiences in my developer journey thus far. 
											Also, I will be the first to admit that my GitHub is a mess, 
											but I'm working on it a bit more every day. 
											And I'm not calling you out any more than I am calling myself out."
										</p>
										<h4>The Little Green Squares</h4>
										<p>
											Now that that is out of the way, who really cares if you have dark green or light green squares 
											all the way across your GitHub profile for as long as you have been a developer? 
											To put it frankly, in my experience, you're probably actually the only person on the planet who cares.
										</p>
										<p>
											The green squares are cool, and if you are a visual goal-driven person, 
											then by all means, use those squares to drive you to code as much as you can
											so that you can continue to learn and become a better developer.
										</p>
										<p>
											If, however, you find yourself opening a project you were working on, 
											adding a comment that you will later delete, or changing the color of 
											something to "test" how it looks, then you quickly make a commit to get
											that little green square (Yes, I will be the first to admit that I have done this.), 
											then you may want to reconsider the green squares.
										</p>
										<p>
											Instead of pushing yourself to have 365 green squares every year 
											to "prove that you can code" or "show how dedicated you are," 
											you may want to utilize other features of GitHub instead.
										</p>
										<h4>What Else Is There?</h4>
										<p>
											Honestly, I'm still discovering new things on GitHub on a regular basis, 
											but I can say without a doubt that the green squares are not the coolest, 
											best, or most likely to help you get a job features available. 
											If you're looking for something to use, you can check out the free apps in Marketplace. 
											If you're bored, you can check out random things under the explore tab, 
											and you can play around with codespaces which allow you to code in the browser. 
											No download is needed.
										</p>
										<p>
											While all of these things sound like fun to explore and play around with, 
											I tend to be more of the person who asks not what I can get but what I
											can give to make the community better. There are three features of GitHub 
											that I feel can be utilized to contribute to the community. The first of which isâ€¦
										</p>
										<h5>1. Open Source Contributions</h5>
										<p>
											There are so many open-source repos out there, and many of them are in 
											desperate need of contribution. Not only can you brag on your resume 
											that you are an open source contributor, but you also gain experience 
											in coding with others (which benefits them too), working on larger projects 
											(which looks good on a resume but also helps the team succeed), and it's 
											just a lot of fun (and you can meet some pretty cool people too). I highly
											recommend open-source contributing. It can be intimidating, and it can be a 
											lot of work getting in there and getting started, but it is totally worth the 
											effort, and when that first pull request is accepted, and your changes are added 
											to the project, you get this overwhelming sense of pride that words really cannot explain. 
											If you ever doubt that you're a software engineer, find an open-source README that 
											needs some TLC, make a few changes and a pull request, and you will change your mind.
